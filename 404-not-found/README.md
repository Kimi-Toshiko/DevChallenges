## Overview

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

The demo of this page can be seen in the links above.

Creation of this page was pretty easy. The only thing that annoyed me a little bit, was how to make the picture look of the normal size on each type and size of the screen.

I have practiced skills, which were a bit forgottent before.
