<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

The demo of the website can be seen through the link above in the 'demo' section.

The challenge was to create a responsive webpage on the theme of interior design. One of the main features was creation of hamburger menu, which would be working properly. Creating it was fun, I had a chance to remember the rules of working with animations and jquery.

Thorugh this lesson I have remembered and made stronger knowledge about CSS animations, their working flow, main rules and correct appliance to the web page to make everything work smoothly and correctly.
