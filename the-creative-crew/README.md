<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

The demo of this page can be seen in the links above.

To create this page I have used such languages as HTML and CSS. However, CSS was processed through Sass preprocessor. Repetitive things in the styles were removed to mixins and included through them into main sheets.

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/wBunSb7FPrIepJZAg0sY) was to create a page with 404 error.
